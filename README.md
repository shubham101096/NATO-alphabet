# NATO-alphabet
The program can help us in finding right words to spell out our name on a phone call. 
The NATO word for each alphabet is stored in a csv file.
The user can enter his name or any word as input. The program will output the corresponding NATO word for each albhabet in the word input by the user.
The project uses pandas library to read from csv file.
